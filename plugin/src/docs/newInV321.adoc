== What's New in Version 3.2.1

=== Default SecurityContextHolder strategy

Version 3.2.1 of the plugin now uses `"MODE_INHERITABLETHREADLOCAL"` as the default strategy. This means that newly created threads inherit the security context of the parent thread.

[WARNING]
====
Beware when using thread pools. Threads keep the security context they inherit when the thread is created the first time. The context isn't updated when the thread is reused for a different task.
